            <td>
              &#10133;  When compared with other methodologies, Waterfall focuses most on a clear, defined set of steps.
            </td> 
            <td>
              &#10134;  The Waterfall model entirely depends on the sequential steps which make the team move forward. The Waterfall methodology is a traditional approach which leaves almost no room for revisions or changes after completion of each step.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
              &#10133; Waterfallâ€™s approach is highly methodical, so it should come as no surprise that the methodology emphasizes a clean transfer of information at each step.
            </td> 
            <td>
              &#10134; The testing cannot be delayed until the half last of the project as it can be risky. Testing phase comes late in the developmental process and Waterfall insists the testing to be done until the stage arrives. In Waterfall, project testing takes considerable time to complete due to which large revisions can cause substantial delays.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
              &#10133; early end-goal determination. It is a defining feature of the Waterfall system that it commits to a goal and specifies the product at the beginning stages. 
            </td> 
            <td>
              &#10134; The main purpose of the Waterfall Methodology is to help the internal team to move more proficiently through the project phases. As it is an internal process the focus on the involvement of end client in the project is very little. 
            </td> 

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
              &#10133; As the Waterfall model has different phases, the output of each phase is analyzed before it is sent to the next phase. This standard data supervision can reduce the risk of problematic issues.
            </td> 
            <td>
              &#10134; Waterfall Model does not test complex and object-oriented models at every stage. Moreover, it does not remove the error during the process. Waterfall model, testing phase is the only stage which detects the error. 
            </td> 

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
              &#10133; Quality assurance tests are performed before the completion of each phase. This includes validation and verification. If an error occurs on a certain stage, it is removed instantly, and the problem gets resolved.
            </td> 
            <td>
              &#10134; The waterfall process does not perform step-wise testing, therefore, any issue can cause a lot of problems later. As there is no turning back, once a mistake has been made it can not be resolved in the next phase.
